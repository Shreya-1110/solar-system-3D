# 3D Solar System Simulation – Internship Assignment

This is a fully interactive 3D simulation of the solar system built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **Three.js** — created as part of a frontend development internship assignment.

It simulates planetary orbits around the sun, visual orbit paths, textured surfaces, and interactive controls — all built without any frameworks.
